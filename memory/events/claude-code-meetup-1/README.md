## 🎤 Featured Presentations

### Stephen Dillon - Fiber Network Optimization

A keynote on building graph-based network tools for telecom infrastructure, showcasing how Claude accelerated complex domain work from months to days.

**Key Takeaway**: Claude significantly reduced development time for sophisticated graph-based infrastructure tools.

**Tech Stack**: React, MapGL, Kafka, Graph DB

### Miha Rothl - Specification-Driven Development with Claude

A compelling case study in building production-grade systems with Claude as an AI pair programmer. Miha showcased how specification-driven development (SDD) and proper constraints enable solo builders to match the output of multi-person teams.

**Key Achievements:**
- Built a legal tech agentic RAG system for Irish law in 2 months
- Generated ~80,000 lines of production-quality code with comprehensive test coverage
- Matched a 6-person team's output from the prior year (in half the time and with better code quality)
- Demonstrated the economic shift: one person + Claude can now build what once required significant team and budget

**Project Highlights - Legal Direct:**
- Full-stack legal research platform with crawler, parser, embedder, vector database, APIs, and TypeScript frontend
- 100% test coverage on libraries, 80%+ integration test coverage on APIs
- Deployed on Kubernetes with GPU infrastructure

**Core Philosophy:**
Claude operates at a senior software engineer level, not junior. Success requires:
- Clear specifications (RFC documents) as the interface between human and AI
- Strong architectural constraints and patterns
- Comprehensive testing and quality gates
- Domain expertise from the human developer

**Key Insight - The Economic Shift:**
- **2024**: Need budget, team, meetings, roadmap
- **2025**: One person with clear vision + Claude can design, implement, enforce quality, and deploy
- "Solo builders can punch with the force of a small IT department"
