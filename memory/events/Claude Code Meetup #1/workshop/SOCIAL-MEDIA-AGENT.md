## Content Creation Framework

### Step 1: Choose Your Hook Type

| Hook Type | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| **Bold Statement** | "AI changed everything about how I work." |
| **Question** | "What if you could build a website in 5 minutes?" |
| **Statistic** | "87% of developers will use AI tools by 2025." |
| **Personal Story** | "I just attended my first Claude Code workshop..." |
| **Contrarian** | "Most people are using AI wrong." |
| **Curiosity Gap** | "I discovered something that 10x'd my productivity." |

### Step 2: Structure Your Post

**Hook → Value → Call-to-Action**

```
🪝 HOOK (First 1-2 lines)
Grab attention immediately

📦 VALUE (Middle section)
Deliver the insight, story, or information
- Use bullet points for tips
- Short paragraphs for stories
- Numbers for lists

🎯 CTA (End)
Ask a question, invite engagement, or direct to action
```

### Step 3: Adapt to Platform

**LinkedIn Example:**
```
Just attended the Claude Code Community Workshop in Dublin.

Here's what blew my mind:

→ Built a complete landing page in 10 minutes
→ Added SEO with a single prompt
→ Deployed to production before the pizza arrived

The future of development isn't about writing code.
It's about directing AI to write it for you.

What's your experience with AI-assisted development?

```

**Twitter/X Example:**
```
Just built a full website at the Claude Code workshop in Dublin 🤯

10 minutes. One prompt. Zero templates.

The future of coding is here and it's conversational.
```

**Instagram Example:**
```
Best Monday ever 🚀

Attended my first Claude Code workshop and built an entire website from scratch. Not by writing code line by line...

But by having a conversation with AI.

The craziest part? It took 10 minutes.

If you're a developer and you're not using AI tools yet, you're about to be left behind.

## Writing Style Guidelines

### DO ✅
- **Be authentic** - Share real experiences and genuine reactions
- **Provide value** - Teach something, inspire, or entertain
- **Use specifics** - "10 minutes" beats "quickly"
- **Show personality** - Your unique voice makes content memorable
- **Ask questions** - Invite engagement and conversation
- **Use formatting** - Line breaks, bullets, emojis (platform-appropriate)

### DON'T ❌
- **Sound like a robot** - No corporate jargon or marketing speak
- **Oversell** - Authentic > promotional
- **Use clickbait** - Deliver on your hook's promise
- **Hashtag spam** - Quality over quantity
- **Be vague** - Specifics create credibility
- **Copy others** - Add your unique perspective

---

## Engagement Boosters

### Questions That Work
- "What's your experience with [topic]?"
- "Anyone else notice this?"
- "What would you add to this list?"
- "Agree or disagree?"
- "What's your take?"

### Formatting Tips
- **Line breaks** make posts scannable
- **Emojis** add personality (use sparingly on LinkedIn, more on Instagram)
- **Numbers** attract attention ("5 things I learned...")
- **Bold statements** stop the scroll
- **Lists** are easy to consume

### Best Times to Post (General)
| Platform | Best Times |
|----------|-----------|
| LinkedIn | Tue-Thu, 8-10am or 12pm |
| Twitter/X | Weekdays, 9am-12pm |
| Instagram | Mon-Fri, 11am-1pm, 7-9pm |
| Facebook | Wed-Fri, 1-4pm |

**Output:**

---

**LinkedIn Post** (1,247 characters)

```
I walked into a Claude Code workshop skeptical.

I walked out wondering why I ever wrote boilerplate code by hand.

Here's what happened in Dublin last night:

→ Downloaded a template and a PRD document
→ Typed "build me a website using these files"
→ Watched Claude Code create a complete landing page
→ Added SEO optimization with one more prompt
→ Had a live website before the pizza arrived

Total time: 45 minutes. Zero frustration.

The wildest part? I spent more time deciding on colors than actually "coding."

This isn't about AI replacing developers.
It's about developers becoming 10x more productive.

We're not writing code anymore.
We're directing it.

If you haven't tried AI-assisted development yet, you're missing out on the biggest productivity leap since Stack Overflow.

Have you experimented with AI coding tools? What's been your experience?
